## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="vhpicture.jpg">

Hello! Hallo! Halo! I am Vanessa Aisyahsari Hanschke (Pronouns: she/her), a PhD student with the [Interactive Artificial Intelligence CDT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/interactive-ai/) at the University of Bristol, UK. I am part of the wonderful [Bristol Interaction Group](https://biglab.co.uk/). My PhD Supervisors are
[Dr. Paul Marshall](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Paul-Marshall-36d4dfa7-1ec3-4168-9226-130e47809b65/) and [Dr. Edwin Simpson](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/edwin-d-simpson).


## Research Interest

In my PhD, I am currently exploring how developers can be encouraged to reflect on the ethical aspects of their data and AI practise. My wider research interests include:

* Ethical literacy for data and AI practitioners
* Data and AI ethics, responsible AI, explainable AI
* AI literacy for non-experts
* Speculative design and storytelling methods


## News

Check out our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10438) accepted at the upcoming CHI conference on my PhD project Data Ethics Emergency Drill. 

Would you like to test your responsible AI practice? I am looking for data and/or AI developer teams (data scientists, AI/ML engineers, etc.) More info [here](/deed)
