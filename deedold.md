## Data Ethics Emergency Drill ðŸ§¯

The data ethics emergency drill (DEED) is similar to a fire drill, where a team plays out a scenario of some issue that has come up with their data science/ML/AI system that has ethical implications. An ethics emergency could be, for example, a hiring algorithm that has only been tested on young people and, once it was deployed, discriminated against old people. The DEED's main goal is to help technologists reflect on the ethics of their applications and practice having conversations around ethical concerns.

We have so far run three iterations of this study with two different data science teams and now created a toolbox with instructions to craft their very own drills, to challenge their team members and exercise their responsible AI muscles. 

If you are part of or know a team who would like to carry out a DEED, please get in touch with me: vanessa[dot]hanschke[at]bristol[dot]ac[dot]uk



### FAQ

**How much time do these activities take?**
The activity can be split into two workshops of at least an afternoon each:
1. The first workshop would be held with some senior team members to design the drill to make it specific to your applications. (minimum one person)
2. The second workshop would involve a small group to act out the drill in a meeting. (minimum 3 people)
All activities can be extended on request depending on the context.


**Does this need to be in person?**
No, it can be conducted entirely online but can also be done in person.


**What does a team get out of this?**
Lots! They get to explore what problems their current processes might have, uncover difficulties they have not anticipated, discover roadblocks which need to be removed or find possible solutions to be prepared for in case of an actual ethics emergency. It also makes for a great team-building activity.


**Why is it called a drill?** 
You never know if the theoretical training and evacuation plan for a fire emergency can work until you test it out in a fire drill of the building. A fire drill can give you a clearer idea of how long it will take for people to react and if they will know how to move as a group with a sense of urgency. This is the experience we are trying to recreate in our ethics emergency drills. Unlike common responsible AI tools such as frameworks and checklists, the DEED is embedded into the workplace context


**What will the researcher get out of this?**
I am interested in how the participants' interaction shapes solution finding and the general types of problems and solutions that come up. I know that poking at the internal processes can be a sensitive topic, however, I am not interested in the specific issues of a participating team. Rather I am interested in the effectiveness of the method and how to improve the design and its replicability.
